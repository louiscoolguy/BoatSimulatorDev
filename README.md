# Boat Sim; A small scale game project by louis/benix 👍
## How to
- Build: Use g++ and start b.bat
- Move: WASD
- Show hitboxes: Press F1
- Show part of world generation using perlin noise: Press F1
- Every time you reopen the game the world gen changes
- Press E while hovering over character to make ding sound (kinda dumb)

## Commands
- type commands into the command prompt
- "setfps [desired]"—set fps
- "fps"—tells you the fps
- "delta"—tells you the delta time
